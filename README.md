The buzz ðŸ“š

AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3 storage, Node.js, Serverless

The idea and how it works ðŸ’¡

The scheduled Lambda function kicks off fetching the data from the two provided endpoints (/products, /images) every 30 days (time chosen at random). The function first fetches the data from the endpoints via node-fetch and merges the results. By using the AWS SDK it sends the merged data to the S3 storage. 

I chose the S3 bucket because it's quite easy to set up and interract with. I think it serves a good flexibility and visibility in terms of what it can do/ from what resources it can get the data and where it can send the data to (via permissions). 

To retrieve the data from the bucket I used API Gateway and another Lambda function which if it has the optional parameter /{productId} provided - it fetches the product by it's id(sku), otherwise it will log an error and return 502.

The tools ðŸ”¨

AWS SDK - interraction with AWS console/storage 
Node-fetch - easier, more readable promises
